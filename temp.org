  + bk allowed in char-table (bk-ct): e.g. ?1
  + bk never in char-table (bk-n-ct): e.g. next

  + event allowed in char-table
    - event has no modifiers (ev-ct-n-mod): e.g. ?1
    - event has modifiers (ev-ct-mod): e.g. ?\C-l

  + event never in char-table
    - event has no modifiers (ev-n-ct-n-mod) : e.g. next
    - event has one modifier (ev-n-ct-1-mod): e.g. C-next
    - event has multiple modifier (ev-n-ct-1-mod): e.g. C-next
